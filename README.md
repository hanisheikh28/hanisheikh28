💫 About Me:
🧑‍💻 Small Introduction
Hi there! I’m an MCA student at PES College of Engineering, Mandya, passionate about becoming a Java Full Stack Developer. I enjoy learning new technologies and building projects that solve real-world problems.

🚀 I’m currently working on Improving my Java backend development skills and building mini full-stack projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects or college-level tech projects related to Java or web development.

💬 I’m looking for help with Understanding Spring Boot, database integration, and best practices in full-stack app development.

🌱 I’m currently learning: Advanced Java, JDBC, and starting with Spring Framework to strengthen my backend knowledge.

💡 Ask me about: Java basics, web development, or tips for getting started with coding as a beginner.

⚡ Fun fact: I feel like a magician when a line of code finally works — it’s the best kind of debugging victory! 🪄💻
